# Random Pairing App
This is a web app that uses my random pair function that is deployed through heroku at https://random-pair.herokuapp.com/ that will randomly pair a list of names. If there is an odd number of names, the last name will be joined with the last random pair.

You can also run app.rb from the terminal.
